Project Overview

Design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a small business that you are closely familiar with.


Here are some app ideas to help you brainstorm:

- Details about a small business in your neighborhood

- Contact info and description about your workplace or school

- Info about a special interest group (like a club or sports team) youâ€™re part of and how new members can sign up


Your design should include:

- at least one photo representing the business

- Name

- Description

- Phone Number

- Address

- Website (optional)

- Hours of Operation (optional)


Note: Be sure to check with the business for permission to use their name and details before you share your work publicly.
